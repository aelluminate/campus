[Campus.](https://campus.aelluminate.com) is an organization where we aim to provide a platform for students, especially computer engineering students, to learn and grow. We provide resources, tutorials, and projects to help students learn and grow. We also provide a platform for students to showcase their projects, publicize their work (with permission), and get discovered by potential employers. We also provide a platform for students to collaborate and work on projects together.
